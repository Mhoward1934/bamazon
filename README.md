# bamazon
This application is desgined to take customer orders from a list of available products.  The application utilizes the terminal to complete the transactions, deplete stock, and provide the customer with a total of their order.

1. The image below shows the start of the program.  The customer would access this program using the Terminal and from the command line enter "node bamazonCustomer.js".  The program will then generate a list of products that can be purchased.  The customer is then instructed to enter and "Item ID" number for the product they wish to order.  Once the product number is entered they are then asked how many of the product they wish to purchase.  The program then displays the customer's selection.  The customer is then asked what would they like to do next "Continue Shopping", "Checkout", or "Quit".

2. Should the customer choose a quantity over the available stock they will receive a message stating "Sorry, this amount is greater than what we have in inventory at this time.  Please try again." and will then be asked what would they like to do next "Continue Shopping", "Checkout", or "Quit".  At this point the customer can choose to Continue Shopping and enter the appropriate quantity for the product they would like to purchase.
